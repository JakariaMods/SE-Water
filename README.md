# SE-Water
Water Mod for Space Engineers

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2200451495

This water mod is not to be confused with the pre-existing water mods. It is written from scratch and does not rely on the aero mod to function. This mod contains audio, splashing, bubbles, boat wake, underwater ambience, seagulls, fish, and better simulation performance compared to older water mods.

This mod has official support for Draygo's Aerodynamics Mod, it is not required but with it you can make rudders and get more accurate physics.
