# SE-Water
Water Mod for Space Engineers

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2200451495

This water mod is not to be confused with the pre-existing water mods. It is written from scratch and does not rely on the aero mod to function. This mod contains audio, splashing, bubbles, boat wake, underwater ambience, seagulls, fish, and better simulation performance compared to older water mods.

This mod has official support for Draygo's Aerodynamics Mod, it is not required but with it you can make rudders and get more accurate physics.

Basic Guide:
To set up the water mod, all you have to do is go to a planet and type /wcreate in your players chat box. If you are unable to type these commands, you may not have the correct permissions, you must be SpaceMaster or higher. Further customization is available below.

Building boats with this water mod is much different. It calculates buoyancy based on gas tanks below the water and does not fake buoyancy based on the size of the grid. It behaves like you would expect a gas tank in water would and allows for submarines by just emptying the tanks a little. Hydrogen gas is more buoyant the oxygen gas.

Use player chat box to input commands, default key is 'Enter' and do not include brackets.

Thanks ShadeStuff for creating a proper water and splash texture :)
